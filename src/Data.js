  AboutTextParagraph1: "My name is Marta Vieira, I’m an artist and student living on a windswept Portuguese island, where the Atlantic’s drama—crashing waves, golden cliffs, and emerald forests—fuels my canvases. When I’m not buried in books, I’m translating the wild soul of this place into art, blending bold strokes and subtle hues to capture its fleeting magic.",
  AboutTextParagraph2: "Every piece here is a fragment of me and my surroundings: sunlight dancing on tide pools, the quiet strength of ancient stone walls, or the blush of bougainvillea against cobalt skies. Through painting and sketching, I explore how nature’s imperfections shape its beauty—a harmony that inspires both my art and my view of the world. Welcome to my gallery, where my heart is on display.",
